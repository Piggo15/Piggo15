Musician

Ever since my early childhood, I have had a fasination with music. I started out doing chorus all througout elementary school through my school and my church, and in 6th grade I made the switch to band, where I fell in love with the Horn. I've still been playing brass for my high school career through my zoned school's marching band. Unfortunatley, I haven't been able to touch the Horn for a while, but I have been able to play my second favorite instrument through the marching band: the mellophone. Our band is a very strong competitive one, so that is where most of my time is going at the moment. The coolest thing I have been able to do so far is be able to look foward to marching in the Rose Bowl parade on New Years day 2025. I got my start working with Zink and the team for creating the soundtrack to our still unreleased game, GoblinBane.
