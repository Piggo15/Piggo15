  What do I do?

<h3>
  "Professional" Indie Dev
</h3>
<h6>
  Totally didn't steal this idea from Zink's README
</h6>

<p>
  As a "professional" Indie Dev, I work with Zink and the team as an employee for Zinklof.Dev and formerly worked for GearSpin Studios. I mainly create music for our games, but recently I have been diving deep into the programming side of our projects. I am currently (as of the 2024-2025 school year) a junior in high school. I attend a special magnet school with Zink specifically for game development and IT stuff. I currently have spent about three years working in the Unity Game Engie, and have really started getting really familiar to how the engine works. I currently have three Unity certifications, all three of the Unity User level certifications. I'm looking at getting Associate or professional level certifications, but I don't know if they'll be availible to me. We just very recently got the Unreal Engine, so I am going to attempt to learn that too. In addition, I've worked in Visual Studio, and I have some very basic experience in Autodesk Maya and Photoshop. As a student, I am still very much learning a lot. At my school, we have the opprotunity to work for certifications, so I have been working on those for quite a while. Also as a student, and as a minor, I don't really have acess to much time, but I'm learning as much as I can.

<h3>
Musician
</h3>
<p>
Ever since my early childhood, I have had a fasination with music. I started out doing chorus all througout elementary school through my school and my church, and in 6th grade I made the switch to band, where I fell in love with the Horn. I've still been playing brass for my high school career through my zoned school's marching band. Unfortunatley, I haven't been able to touch the Horn for a while, but I have been able to play my second favorite instrument through the marching band: the mellophone. Our band is a very strong competitive one, so that is where most of my time is going at the moment. The coolest thing I have been able to do so far is be able to look foward to marching in the Rose Bowl parade on New Years day 2025. I got my start working with Zink and the team for creating the soundtrack to our still unreleased game, GoblinBane.
